This is an example application, generated with supabase template, that uses Analog, Angular, and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication, database access, and SSR.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the application dependencies.

## Supabase Setup

- Create a new project in Supabase.
- Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the Supabase environment variables from your `API settings`.
- Add a user with `email/password` under the `Authentication` section.

## Development
