# Version Compatiblity

Analog is compatible across multiple versions of Angular, Nx, and Vite.

Its always recommended to use the latest version of Analog because there are bug fixes and features continually being added.

Below is a reference table that matches versions of Nx and Angular with the Analog version that is compatible with it.

The table shows the minimum version of Nx, the supported Angular version, and the minimum supported version of Analog and Vite.
