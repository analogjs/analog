The sponsorship also builds brand recognition and improves conversion.

### Sponsoring as an Individual

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Analog, consider sponsoring me as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while. If you are not comfortable with a monthly-recurring sponsorship, GitHub also supports one-time donations!

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Analog as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.
