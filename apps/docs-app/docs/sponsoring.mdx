### Business/Corporate Sponsorships

Supporting OSS improves your brand's reputation, which is an important asset for any company that interacts with developers.

If you are using Analog to build a revenue-generating product, sponsoring its development also helps your interests. it ensures the projects that your product relies on stay healthy and actively maintained. It also provides your brand with a positive position in the community also makes it easier to find and recruit Angular developers. The sponsorship also builds brand recognition and improves conversion.

### Sponsoring as an Individual

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Analog, consider sponsoring me as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while. If you are not comfortable with a monthly-recurring sponsorship, GitHub also supports one-time donations!

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Analog as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.

If you have any questions regarding sponsorships, please contact us at sponsor@analogjs.org.
